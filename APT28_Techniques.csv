31,Input Capture,APT28 has used tools to perform keylogging.
32,Logon Scripts,An APT28 loader Trojan adds the Registry key HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript to establish persistence.
34,Network Sniffing,"APT28 deployed the open source tool Responder to conduct NetBIOS Name Service poisoning, which captured usernames and hashed passwords that allowed access to legitimate credentials."
35,Obfuscated Files or Information,"APT28 encrypted a .dll payload using RTL and a custom encryption algorithm. APT28 has also obfuscated payloads with base64, XOR, and RC4.[13][21][9][18][15]"
36,Office Application Startup,APT28 has used the Office Test persistence mechanism within Microsoft Office by adding the Registry key HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf to execute code.
37,Pass the Hash,APT28 has used pass the hash for lateral movement.
38,Peripheral Device Discovery,APT28 uses a module to receive a notification every time a USB mass storage device is inserted into a victim.
39,PowerShell,APT28 downloads and executes PowerShell scripts.
40,Process Discovery,An APT28 loader Trojan will enumerate the victim's processes searching for explorer.exe if its current process does not have necessary permissions.
41,Remote File Copy,"APT28 has downloaded additional files, including by using a first-stage downloader to contact the C2 server to obtain the second-stage implant."
42,Replication Through Removable Media,APT28 uses a tool to infect connected USB devices and transmit itself to air-gapped computers when the infected USB device is inserted.
43,Rootkit,APT28 has used a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) rootkit known as LoJax.
44,Rundll32,"APT28 executed CHOPSTICK by using rundll32 commands such as rundll32.exe ""C:\Windows\twain_64.dll"". APT28 also executed a .dll for a first stage dropper using rundll32.exe. An APT28 loader Trojan saved a batch script that uses rundll32 to execute a DLL payload."
45,Screen Capture,APT28 has used tools to take screenshots from victims.
46,Scripting,An APT28 loader Trojan uses a batch script to run its payload. The group has also used macros to execute payloads.
47,Spearphishing Attachment,APT28 sent spearphishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office attachments.
48,Spearphishing Link,APT28 sent spearphishing emails which used a URL-shortener service to masquerade as a legitimate service and to redirect targets to credential harvesting sites.
49,Standard Application Layer Protocol,"APT28 used SMTP as a communication channel in various implants, initially using self-registered Google Mail accounts and later compromised email servers of its victims. Later implants such as CHOPSTICK use a blend of HTTP and other legitimate channels, depending on module configuration."
50,Steal Application Access Token,"APT28 has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications masquerading as ""Google Defender"" ""Google Email Protection,"" and ""Google Scanner"" for Gmail users. They also targeted Yahoo users with applications masquerading as ""Delivery Service"" and ""McAfee Email Protection""."
